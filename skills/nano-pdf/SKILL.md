# nano-pdf

Use `nano-pdf` to apply edits to a specific page in a PDF using a natural-language instruction.

## Quick start

```bash
nano-pdf edit deck.pdf 1 "Change the title to 'Q3 Results' and fix the typo in the subtitle"
```

Notes:

- Resolve page numbering from installed help and inspect the target page before editing a copy; do not mutate one page then blindly retry another.
- Always sanity-check the output PDF before sending it out.
