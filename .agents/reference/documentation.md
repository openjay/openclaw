# Documentation work

Read when editing public docs, README links, UI copy or translations. This contributor reference is under `.agents/` and is not a published Mintlify page.

## Docs Linking (Mintlify)

- Docs are hosted on Mintlify (docs.openclaw.ai).
- Internal doc links in `docs/**/*.md`: root-relative, no `.md`/`.mdx` (example: `[Config](/configuration)`).
- When working on Mintlify pages, use the mintlify skill if available through the current skill catalog; follow the repository conventions below.
- For docs, UI copy, and picker lists, order services/providers alphabetically unless the section is explicitly describing runtime behavior (for example auto-detection or execution order).
- Section cross-references: use anchors on root-relative paths (example: `[Hooks](/configuration#hooks)`).
- Doc headings and anchors: avoid em dashes and apostrophes in headings because they break Mintlify anchor links.
- When Peter asks for links, reply with full `https://docs.openclaw.ai/...` URLs (not root-relative).
- When you touch docs, end the reply with the `https://docs.openclaw.ai/...` URLs you referenced.
- README (GitHub): keep absolute docs URLs (`https://docs.openclaw.ai/...`) so links work on GitHub.
- Docs content must be generic: no personal device names/hostnames/paths; use placeholders like `user@gateway-host` and “gateway host”.

## Docs i18n (zh-CN)

- `docs/zh-CN/**` is generated; do not edit unless the user explicitly asks.
- Pipeline: update English docs → adjust glossary (`docs/.i18n/glossary.zh-CN.json`) → run `scripts/docs-i18n` → apply targeted fixes only if instructed.
- Before rerunning `scripts/docs-i18n`, add glossary entries for any new technical terms, page titles, or short nav labels that must stay in English or use a fixed translation (for example `Doctor` or `Polls`).
- When present in the checked-out `package.json`, `pnpm docs:check-i18n-glossary` enforces glossary coverage for changed English doc titles and short internal doc labels before translation reruns.
- Translation memory: `docs/.i18n/zh-CN.tm.jsonl` (generated).
- See `docs/.i18n/README.md`.
- If the translation pipeline stalls, report the exact blocker. Contact the responsible maintainer only when authorized to send a message.

Verify script availability in the revision being changed. The local instruction overlay can be ahead of the base checkout; an absent validator is unverified, not PASS. For document-only work use the relevant format/link checks rather than invoking runtime health or release commands.
